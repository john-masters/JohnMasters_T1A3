- The style guide I will be adhering to is PEP8.

# R6 - Features
- Can fight opponents in battle area and win money.

There will be 5 opponents to choose from with randomised levels (some above, and below player's level).
Opponents will have level and name displayed

User chooses enemy, and if player level higher than enemy, player adds enemies level to theirs.
If you lose a fight, you go back to the beginning

Once 5 opponents are finished, there will be a boss. 
After you defeat the boss, there will be 5 new opponents to choose from.

(May add in a feature where you get a new attack style (in game description only) after beating boss)
for example, first 5 opponents you beat unarmed, after first boss you get sword, then after second boss gun

After you defeat 3 bosses, you win the game and the time it took you to beat the game is your score.

- Marketplace to purchase armour, which gives you a second life. If you lose a battle, you just lose your armour. 

- Score list (Scores are relative to time taken to beat game)
